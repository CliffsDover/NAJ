Any second thoughts about this...

Doing some vacuuming?

Have you seen Rufus?

Knuckles got out of his cage!

Knuckles got out of his cage again!

Guess I'll be going.

Where did you leave your hearing aid?

What happened to your cane?

Cool pocket knife, could I see it?

So, what's on TV?

I earned a dollar from Grandma!

I need to get going here...

I heard you took Grandpa to the park this morning...

... so he bought another cane?

... a pocket knife?

Grandma and Grandpa are visiting today!

Could you help me get out of here?

... but Morry and Anderson are waiting for me!

What would it take for you to get me out of this?

I'll leave you to your seclusion.

How much is the Haute Dog?

I'd like to buy a Haute Dog!

You're quite the salesman.

How can you be so excited about a hotdog?

Nevermind.

You liked role-playing games?

You didn't have a dainty ponytail?

You weren't undergoing treatment for melanoma?

You were a weakeling?

You could give me 18 double-odd strength?

I just need to run in for a second...

How could I get a membership here?

I'm not interested...

Could I resume my workout now?

Could I go on that tour again?

Could I check out the locker rooms?

Have you seen Grandpa's hearing aid anywhere?

How was your shower?

This is extortion!

Why don't YOU get your brownies?

Why can't you just give me the hearing aid?

I like your style, Thurston...

I need to get going...

Why is our game cancelled?

Where's Anderson?

Where's Morry?

... curses!

... blast!

I'll round those two up like a pair of 10-siders!

I'm off!

What are you building here?

What's with the walkie talkie?

What was being built here again?

Could you let me back there?

Well I need to get going here...

So what's cookin'?

What kind of stew is it?

I heard you were making brownies today!

Which ingredient were you missing for the brownies?

Are the brownies ready yet?

Have you seen Rufus around?

How do you turn the dishwasher on?

I need to get going here.

That bird has Grandpa's cane!

What kind of drinks are those?

Have you tried one of those Haute Dogs?

I need to get that cane down!

Could I have one of your drinks?

... was the Kaboom! energy bar any good?

Are you done with that drink yet?

What are you doing in here!?

We've got dungeons to conquer, villains to slay!

Put some clothes on, man!

... argh, my eyes!

Don't get too comfortable...

It's ... great?

Could I look around more on my own?

I'm not here to exercise!

How could I get a temporary membership?

I just need a minute to find my friend!

Is this it?

I've seen enough for now...

Could I move on to another exercise?

I'm not sure how I should use this...

I need a break!

What are you listening to?

What's with the cooler...

I'm ready for battle!

Could I borrow that cooler?

When does class finish?

Break that board again!

I brought a board for you to break!

I think there's a draft in here.

I need to go to the bathroom...

You're just standing there...

How many extra batteries did you bring?

I earned a DOLLAR from Grandma!

// **** CONVERSATION MESSAGES ARE BELOW ****
... Grandpa did lock me in the closet once.

You were playing hide and seek!

... I survived on a cream egg left over from Easter!

... doing some vacuuming?

Yep!

Grandpa let Knuckles out of his cage this morning...

... he made a mess!

... I'm a little worried about him if Grandma's around!

I've been keeping an eye on him...

... he's sleeping in the laundry room right now.

I guess I need to go put him away then...

Okey-doke.

You and Grandpa are going to have so much fun today!

... I CAN'T HEAR A THING WITHOUT MY HEARING AID!

... NOT GETTING ANY OF THAT!

...

... NEXT TIME THAT DURNED BIRD COMES AFTER ME...

... OL' GRAMPS'LL BE READY FOR HIM!

Cool knife, could I see it?

... YOU WANT IT AGAIN?

... I'M GETTING VIDEO, NO AUDIO!

... BY THE WAY...

... DON'T GO LETTING THAT CAT AROUND HERE...

... GRANDMA'S COOKIN' GRUB IN THE KITCHEN!

YOU KNOW HOW THOSE TWO CAN GET!

WHAT WAS THAT, BOY?

... WHAT WAS THAT?

Well, no...

... but he bought a pocket knife for self-defense!

... Grandpa's never been known as a rational thinker. 

That's 1d4 points of damage at best...

Oh, that reminds me...

... your wood sword got put in my room somehow.

Dexcalibur!?

... here take it.

... I had no idea until they barged in this morning.

Could you help me out here?

I have high-stakes Slackmaster action scheduled for today...

... I can't waste time patronizing relatives!

... I don't think you can get out.

Mom's in the other hallway, and Grandma and Grandpa are downstairs!

... but Morry and Anderson are already waiting for me!

... for a GAME?

... I'd do anything for Grandma's brownies...

... too bad she couldn't bake any today.

... have fun!

Special matinee price!

... only ONE dollar!

Great!

That'll be ONE dollar.

Um... I don't have it.

Surely you can afford A DOLLAR...

... for the FINEST junk cuisine has to offer!

I guess so...

... but our 7-Layer Haute Dog nearly sells itself!

Right...

... plus I work on commission.

That explains it.

It's still junk food...

How can YOU not be EXCITED by this AMAZING DEAL!

... LOOK at it...

Now doesn't that look delicious?

... for a hotdog.

... come back SOON! This SPECIAL PRICE won't last LONG!

You liked role playing games?

Err, no...

... only nerds do that stuff.

All I wanted from life was to be bigger, stronger, faster...

... a nice six-pack to stare at in the mirror...

Any of this sound familiar, lad?

I hope you're kidding.

I can tell it's eating you up inside...

... I'll tell you what, mister...

... YOU get yourself a membership at this club...

... and I'll PERSONALLY see to your fitness needs!

We'll have your peers GREEN with envy...

... and the girls falling all over themselves for...

... What was the name?

Jackson, but--

... BIG ACTION JACKSON!

I LIKE the sound of that...

Err, no...  

... it's exotic by the way.

... to examine every bit of muscle in the mirror...

... and I'll PERSONALLY see to all your fitness needs!

... I don't even eat melons!

You were a skinny little weakeling?

Err, no... 

I'm nordic you know...

Interested, eh?

I thought so... 

... I have a knack for these types of closet cases.

... I suppose I could role-play some interest in this place...

I KNEW you were interested!

Let's give you a tour of our facilities...

... you can see everything 25-Hour Fitness has to offer!

Sorry, members only...

... that's the rule around here!

Uh, hehe.

I'd recommend a few sessions with a FITNESS PROFESSIONAL first!

Come back if you change your mind!

Let's get to it!

Sure!

Sorry, we need to protect our members' privacy!

Today's a great day to get fit!

Hmm... let me check...

He was in here earlier this morning...

Yep!  It's right here on my dresser!

I just need to give that to him real quick...

I'll tell you what...

You know how much I love Grandma's brownies, right?

... yeah?

Well, why don't you bring me some of those brownies...

... and I'll TRADE you the hearing aid!

You know how Grandma is with her cooking...

... she won't let you go in there and just take them!

I have Grandpa's hearing aid...

... you need Grandpa's hearing aid...

... I need brownies!

It gives me an excuse not to talk to Grandpa...

... a privelege not easily given up!

Fair enough!

I will bring you the brownies...

... and you will give me the hearing aid, correct?

Agreed.

Later...

Why is our game cancelled!

Morry and Anderson both couldn't make it here!

... the only martial arts place I can think of...

... is the Dojo on the other side of town.

He could be at the 25 Hour Fitness downtown...

... but you need a membership to get in there!

Relax man...

Woah...

... easy there.

I'll round them up like a pair of 10-siders!

You do that.

You do that...

See ya...

My boss likes to MOTIVATE remotely...

... sometimes he can get...

... I'M NOT PAYING YOU TO TALK!

... distracting.

... with an accident bound to happen?

No way!

Ok, see ya later.

What's cookin' Grandma?

Pork butt!

... oh boy.

I was!

... but the store was completely out of my secret ingredient!

... Thurston was crushed when he found out!

What!? 

... give out my secret ingredient?

I don't think so buster.

... let me finish chopping these veggies first!

... I don't want him in here, Jackson!

He's always trying to get into my award winning food!

... he's just friendly!

Make sure the latch is closed!

... don't let Rufus in here on your way out!

Maybe it'll drop if he takes off?

I don't see how he could fly with it...

Oh, they're part of my routine...

... I get up real early to buy a 4-pack of these Mocha Coffee drinks at the store!

I drink two of'em in the morning for breakfast...

... and the other two with whatever I have for lunch.

They really help me get through the day...

... plus I'm probably hooked on the caffeine.

Have you tried a 'Haute Dog', yet?

No way, I eat more healthy than that!

I tried one of the new Kaboom! energy bars today...

... they were running a special at the store...

... I figured, 'That's a good deal, why not try it?'

... Eww!

Maybe it'll drop when he takes off?

Sorry...

... that's my last one!

Let's just say it didn't SIT too well with my ROUTINE...

See ya later!

... I thought I'd get a power workout in today.

This isn't exercising...

... you relaxed in here the whole time!

... I'm too comfortable to think about that stuff.

... you're plainly jealous of this physique.

... I'll be back for you!

Isn't it though!

Ho-ho! Anxious to get started, huh?

Unfortunately, you need to either be a member...

... or have an appointment with a FITNESS PROFESSIONAL...

... to be on the club floor or in the locker rooms.

I'm not here to exercise you n00b!

... I'm needed in the lobby.

You need a session with a FITNESS PROFESSIONAL...

... like myself!

I just need a minute to see if my friend is in here...

If you're not serious about fitness...

... you need to wait in the lobby!

Well, there IS the locker room and suana...

... but that's not really part of the tour.

... you need to beef up, boy!

Alrighty then...

As your personal trainer, I don't recommend it...

... you can work every muscle group on these fitness balls!

I'm not sure how I should use this thing.

Hop on!

... I'm a professional!

... I need a minute to warm up first.

... but it's your free session!

Ok!

... just some mix CD's I burned at home.

The TV hasn't been working...

... so I brought in my portable CD player!

... this counter is normally covered in wrapper and foil!

That's my lunch for today!

... eating junk food without TV doesn't feel right!

We're waiting on Morry and Anderson!

We're waiting on Morry!

We're waiting on Anderson!

That's all I have to eat!

We're just getting started here...

... I'll hammer some discipline into you students, yet!

I don't want to waste another board!

... bring one with you next time...

... I'll smash it in two!

... I think there's a draft in here.

Could I close the door?

Leave my doorstop alone!

... alright, you'll need to go outside to find one...

I need to go to the bathroom again...

... again?

Alright, if nature calls...

YOU AREN'T GETTING BY ME!

... I should know better.

// **** room1.crm (bedroom) MESSAGES ARE BELOW ****
Finally, a way out!

I need to figure out a way down though...

This bird's gotta fly!

Not so fast there buster!

Whaaaaaaaaa-UUGGH

Oh don't be such a baby.

There's nowhere to climb to.

Jackson...?

... are you there?

Time to get up!

Grandma and Grandpa are here!

... Zzz-snorrrt!!

They're downstairs waiting for you!

Sleeper...

... must ...

... AWAKEN!

Grandma and Grandpa...?

... visiting again?

Grandpa can't wait to see you!

...I'm supposed to meet Morry and Anderson over at the Gameshop today.

We're starting the new Slackmaster campaign Gamekeep designed for us...

... copious amounts of gold, experience, and hack 'n slash action, guaranteed!

... now, if you'll excuse me...

... just a moment there, mister!

Grandpa lost his cane while he was at the park with Thurston...

... and Grandma can't find all the ingredients she needs for a recipe...

I know you wanted to do some QUESTING today...

... but you need to hop in the shower...

but--

...  clean up...

surely you--

... and spend some good, quality TIME in REALITY with your FAMILY!

... I'll be in the other hallway!

... fury, angst, rebellion...

There must be a way OUT of here...

... without being sand-bagged by these kin!

Hey, it's Dexcalibur!

I haven't seen him since my last live action D&D sesh!

Ahh Dexcalibur...

It feels good to have you in my grasp once again.

It seemed like so many sesh's ago that I held you last.

Ooomph.

It's stuck.

Alright!  It's open now.

The lock is loosened and open now.

I think the window is just stuck in the sill.

Not so fast there buster.

My cranium!

I need to get the window open first.

It's already open.

I believe it's a king size.

That's a choice setup.

I don't want to lug that around.

They fill up some empty space on the wall.

The captain's seat.

I've kind of got them in order...

It's only open a crack.

The window is still stuck in the frame.

There's the hallway.

Ok, I've completely stripped the bed down now.

I think this bed has given me enough.

I'm not sure I've ever opened it...

Why disrupt the wonderful musk cultivating in here?

I wonder if this still opens...

Oooomph.

Have at you!

It's no use...

... the lock is shut tight with dirt and grime.

It's already closed.

It portrays a pitched space battle.

... I'm afraid this battlestation is fully operational!

Dexcalibur might not have enough POWER to pry open this window...

... I might just have to provide a little of my own.

I don't play a DARK PALADDIN with 18-DOUBLE-ODD strength for nothing!

Thank you Dexcalibur, but that was all DARK PALADDIN on that one...

... now if I could just figure out how to get down from here?

... I haven't changed my sheets since...

... since...

... better not to think about it.

This should get that dirt and grime off the lock...

... and now the window should...

OOF

... with just a little push...

UUURRRRRGGGH!

... only open a crack.

I can't seem to open it any further...

... it's stuck in the frame!

My old dice are in there.

It's empty.

My old dice are in here!

Nothing too interesting there.

I don't keep anything interesting in the others.

I'm not sure what's in those.

I don't think I'll need anything from there.

I'm letting those appreciate...

I've got the biggest tower in the neighborhood.

It leads out to the hall.

I don't keep anything important that far away from my computer.

I guess it's been a while since I changed sheets.

It leads out to the hallway.

That's an impressive face print and drool stain combination...

Even by my standards.

I hope that's dry by tonight.

It's no use.

The lock is shut tight with dirt and grime.

I can't just jump out the window.

It's alread open.

Not after I spent all that time getting it open!

This room could use a little fresh air anyways.

It should only open and close.

I just got up.

I haven't changed my sheets since...

That wouldn't be long enough.

I don't feel like making my bed.

I don't have time to get on ol' Bessie right now.

She's already been tweaked and optimized...

... for maximum performance and stealth!

It's not a laptop.

There's nothing in important in those.

I don't know...

... that pillow looks pretty used.

I don't necessarily need to batter my way through...

It's not going to help me open the window.

This won't help me open the window.

I think I cleaned it up enough already.

There's no place to tie it on the window sill.

I don't feel like listening to anything.

I don't have a CD in there right now.

I don't think it can help me this time.

I don't have time to get on ol' Bessie right now...

... I can't go back to sleep now!

I don't have time to sit down at the computer now.

I like that where it is.

I'm already dressed.

All the drawers are closed.

They're loud enough for me...

I don't want to take those apart.

The harsh, volcanic landscape of primordial Earth.

I don't want to take it down.

A small island.

That's too heavy to carry around.

I don't turn it on much.

It's bright enough in here.

That's too high up for me to tie this to.

It's just big enough for my computer to sit on.

There's nothing I need to do at my desk right now.

I should try the drawers...

There's nothing interesting on it.

That's just some of the science fiction I've read!

I don't have time to start on a book.

It's a half-empty soda can.

I'll throw it away later.

I'm not drinking it anymore.

I like them where they are.

I won't need to take those with me.

It's held open by the doorstop.

... Rufus!

We meet... again.

Meeow.

Impressive.

Look who woke up this morning!

Hey Grandma.

You can nose around some...

... but don't start getting into things!

You'll only spoil your appetite!

Oh no you don't!

... I know you're coming for the brownies...

... and they're not ready yet, so out, out, OUT!

... Ok! Ok!

I just took one.

Mom loves these things.

I already have one.

To the victor, go the spoils.

Err... I don't think I can leave without Mom catching me just yet.

It's still propped open.

It's covered with random cutesy stuff.

I try to just get in and get out.

Looks like it's fully stocked.

Those are the drinks Mom's hooked on.

Soda is my beverage of choice.

Mmmmm... those look really good.

They're still pretty hot.

The screendoor leads out the side of the house.

Not while it's running.

It'll get emptied tonight.

Some grease on a sponge never hurt anybody...

It's a swinging door that leads into the living room.

We really don't have anything good in there.

I'm not hungry.

It's too big to move around.

Home base in the kitchen.

Why waste the water?

It's not on.

Sounds like it's on.

Looks like Grandma has something cooking on it.

I don't want to mess around with Grandma's cooking.

It's held open now by the doorstop.

Mmmm, those look really good...

That must be Grandma's stew.

Sure looks greasy!

It looks too hot to touch.

I don't want to mess with Grandma's cooking.

Grandma must've been cutting something on it earlier.

I don't need to chop anything up.

I don't think that would accomplish anything.

... This cutting board works great!

... Rufus better not come in here.

... I wish I could make those brownies today!

I'm making brownies today!

It leads outside.

It's already propped open.

It's being held open by the doorstop.

Grandma's cutting something on it right now.

Watch your fingers!

It's right in the middle of the kitchen.

Mom has all kinds of recipes in those books.

I'm not doing any cooking today.

It's just for decoration.

It's really just for decoration.

We put our cookbooks on here.

It's too heavy for me to move around.

The clean dishes dry out there.

I don't have anything that needs to be dried.

I don't need it.

It looks out over the backyard.

They look nice...

... I guess...

They're better off in the sun.

It never really seems to do anything...

I don't need to mess with that.

Lot's of drawers in here.

Grandma's not going to let me take anything out of here.

... everything I need should be out already.

Someone must've used that for breakfast.

Dishware doesn't excite me.

Maybe I should just take them for now...

Make sure you don't let Rufus in!

Don't get into anything!

These legumes will taste great in that stew...

Doesn't sound like it.

Alright, Thurston...

... I've got those brownies.

Wow!  Already?

Well, a deal's a deal...

... here's Grandpa's hearing aid!

Hey, Thurston... are you in there?

Thurston, are you in there...?

... doesn't sound like it.

... psst!

... you haven't found a way out yet?

... did I leave anything in the bathroom?

... did Grandma make her brownies?

It goes around the corner.

Those are for decoration.

I don't even really notice it anymore.

The gateway to my inner sanctum!

That's Thurston's room.

I don't think there's anything I can use in there.

There's enough light in here.

I'd rather not make the mess.

It's bright enough outside.

There's never anything interesting in there.

It's my bedroom door.

That's a normal looking ceiling fixture.

It could probably use some water...

It's an antique.

Why knock it over?

It's not really portable.

WHAT AM I PAYING YOU FOR?

... YOU CALL THAT WORK?

... YOU'RE NOT A MAN!

I NEED TO DO EVERYTHING FOR YOU!

THIS SITE IS A DUMP!

STAY FOCUSED, YOU!

YOU LITTLE PUNK!

GET BACK HERE!

I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT PAIN IS!

WHY I OUGHT-A...

I'm trying not to hurt myself again...

... I won't get too distracted!

... hey, take it easy!

It's already shut.

... HAMMER FASTER!

WHAT KIND OF A MAN ARE YOU?

I'm not trying to hurt myself here boss!

... Slackmaster is worth it!

Wow! He really flipped out!

... GET BACK HERE!

WE CAN'T LEAVE THIS CONSTRUCTION LOT UNATTENDED!

... YOU BIG BABY!

HEY KID!

... WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' TO MY LABOR!

I don't think I need another one.

It needs a quarter.

I don't think that would help.

It's ready to vend!

HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

YOU ARE NOT TO TAKE THAT GLUE GUN OFF THIS LOT!

Keep your hands off of me!

He's a noisy one.

No, get away!

It's ready to vend.

There are a couple newspapers in there.

It needs a coin to operate.

It's locked.

Somehow I don't think I'll be able to shake a newspaper out of it.

It's back where I came from.

'To vend, insert coin(s) in slot, and open hatch.'

It's the entrance to the game shop.

It's today's paper.

It opens when you pay the machine.

It's open.

I should grab a paper first.

I should just take one off the pile.

It looks like a glue gun.

I can't use it from here.

I don't need to use it right now.

Breaker, breaker...

I'm not a toy!

I don't think it opens.

It needs to go in the coin slot.

They're attached to the machine.

They must've just started putting this frame up.

I'm don't know much about carpentry.

It looks pretty sturdy.

It hasn't all been put up yet.

I don't want to touch that stuff.

I don't want to mess with it.

I don't want to touch it.

It's an old purple bucket.

I can't think of anything to do with it.

Maybe if it wasn't purple.

It's got a bunch of bricks in it.

It's already full with bricks...

It's too heavy to move with all those bricks in it.

I don't need to take that with me.

Looks like it's just starting to get put up.

I'm a warrior, not a mason!

It's cemented together pretty well.

Everything is cemented together.

Those must be for that wall they're putting up back there.

They're already stacked pretty neatly in there.

I don't want to carry a dirty ol' brick around...

The cement mixture is all dried.

The cement mixture has already hardened.

I wouldn't know what to do with it.

That must be ready to get hammered up.

Dexcalibur is suitable enough.

I think Dexcalibur is enough 

I can see Cliff in there.

It's the street signal for traffic

That's the gameshop.

Um, I'm still drinking those...

Oh, sorry.

Could I have one of these?

Sorry, that's my last one...

... it looks like there's one available!

It's just an empty package.

Hotdogs!  Get your hotdogs heeee--yuh!

I'm sorry, our ketchup is for paying Haute Dog customers only.

Sheesh.

It leads back the way I came.

... 7-Layer Hotdog... $3.

I should talk to the hireling if I want to order.

It's a napkin dispenser.

My hands are clean.

I don't need one napkin

Let alone a hundred.

I don't need a napkin right now.

Very functional.

I don't need a break yet.

I suppose it's symbolic of something.

I'm not THAT thirsty.

It looks stable.

No-Action Jackson. Created by Britton O'Toole.

I think it's for display only.

Plaques usually don't come in the 'able to pick up' category.

This has got to be Grandpa's cane.

Looks like that's his last one.

It's was a 4-pack of coffee drinks...

It looks like there's one available...

I usually prefer soda.

I need to have it in my hands.

There's no reason to try break it.

I'm more of a soda guy.

I can't open what I don't have.

There's no reason to break it.

A bottle of ketchup.

I think this hotdog has plenty of topping as it is.

I'm sorry, that's for paying customers only.

That bird still has Grandpa's cane!

He must not be able to fly with it.

Nobody's sitting there.

I don't really feel like sitting down.

There's nothing on it.

It doesn't look very full.

I don't have anything I want to throw away.

No thanks.

I think this place just opened a couple weeks ago.

The stand looks sturdy.

'Tommy Bun's Haute Dog'

Sounds fancy.

It's everything I'd expect to see in a hotdog stand...

Chips, soft drinks, pimply face hireling...

I think I should just give the hireling my order.

I can't reach any of that stuff from out here.

Looks like he's been here a while...

... he must not be very mobile.

I'm not touching that!

No.

It's a big tree.

It's a big green tree.

I can't climb it.

It's very sturdy looking.

There are too many branches to climb it.

That would be a nice spot to sit.

I don't need a break!

Could I interest you in a Tommy Bun Haute Dog today, sir?

Seven-layer Haute Dog... only ONE DOLLAR!

Hmm... it's locked.

... fascinating.

... who'll enter my world of pain!

... owned.

... who is that?

... and now to get Morry.

... I don't need this on anymore.

... that's better.

I know I heard SOMETHING yelling...

... I wonder where it went?

... nobody talks to me like that!

It heads back the way I came.

Something holding it open from the inside.

It's nice and lubricated now.

... YOU LITTLE PUNK!

I should find out where it leads first.

... hello?

Hello?

Looks like he's got the door open now.

It's being held open from inside.

The vent leads back into the air condition machine.

I'm not going to stick my arm in there!

All my gaming experience is with two hands.

A public garbage can.

I'm sure there's all kinds of gross stuff in there.

I don't need to throw anything away.

I'm not sure I want to know what's in there.

It would just mean a big mess for someone to clean up.

Probably me.

I'll leave that for the friendly neighborhood garbageman.

I see Anderson in there!

It looks like he's in class with some other students.

Looks like he's stuck in class.

HEY!

LET MY FRIEND OUT OF THERE!

Doesn't seem like they can hear me.

It runs all the way up the side of the building.

There aren't any openings.

It runs straight down into the air conditioning unit.

It looks too sturdy to manipulate.

Looks like it's on.

I'm sure it's keeping this building cool.

I don't see any sort of controls on the outside.

It looks like the only way in is through that hatch.

It's shut.

It's a small door for the air conditioning unit.

'Free workout at 25 Hour Fitness--

'Inquire inside.'

I guess that's the guy who runs this place.

Looks like a real loon.

It spices up the building a little bit.

I can't reach it.

It a martial arts dojo.

Strange looking poster.

I'd rather leave it on the wall.

It looks healthy.

It doesn't really look climbable.

There isn't any sort of keyhole to tinker with...

Wha...?

... have you seen anything out here harassing my dojo?

... I haven't seen anybody.

Dang it!

It still looks stuck...

Dexcalibur's more of a slashing weapon...

It's lubricated the hatch!

I should open the hatch.

It leads back into the machinery.

... what's up, Gamekeep!

... what was that?

One DARK PALADDIN reporting for BATTLE!

... uhhh...

Oh yeah, I was going to say...

... we CANCELLED the Slackmaster campaign today.

What!?

That's where the gamekeep spends most of his day.

I don't need to play with the wires now that the TV's on.

The cable wire is plugged into it.

The TV wire is plugged into it

Hey, the TV is working now!

... what have I done?

Now that it's on, I don't think I need to be messing with the wires anymore.

C'mon, Jackson...

... can't you see I'm using it right now?

I don't think I need to mess with it now that the TV's on.

It's already on.

All the plugs are in the back.

I'm not sure I could get away with that.

I'm not doing any shopping.

... that is my lunch you know!

That's where the cable plugs into.

That's where the TV plugs into.

The cable wire is plugged into the receiver's cable in.

That's the A/V setup for the shop.

The hangar is plugged into the cable in.

The hangar is plugged into the TV in.

It's plugged in all the way.

I don't think adjusting it will help.

I don't want to mess with it now that the TV's on.

That's where the games are played.

It's in good hands.

I'm not sure how to operate that particular type of machinery.

I don't think Cliff would appreciate that.

It's too heavy to move around.

It's not mine to give away.

Even if I wanted to, it's too heavy to grab.

Those are the back issue boxes.

I'm caught up on most of my storylines.

That would just be a huge mess.

It's a bunch of older action figures and models

What? And possibly lower their condition to near mint?

They're for display only.

The case only opens in the back.

I don't need any of those right now.

There's lots of new stuff this week.

I don't have time to flip through those.

And Cliff would get on my case about not buying anything again.

That would just be a big mess.

I've got enough comics for now.

It looks sturdy enough.

I guess there's no other place for them.

What's with the TV?

The cable box broke...

... and the TV won't pick up any channels without an antennae.

You don't have time to watch it...

... you're running our Slackmaster campaign today, remember!

... I WAS... going to run a campaign today!

... unfortunately, we're missing a couple players.

... that exponential XP growth will just have to wait!

It's working fine now!

I'm not sure I can open it.

It's Cliff's CD player.

I'm using that right now.

It's portable...

Could you leave my lunch alone, please?

I could just take it with me...

Hey, I need that lunch!

Even though... it DOES feel a little strange...

... watching TV in the shop...

... with no real... junk food... 

... he's absorbed in the programming.

That's a good deal for that expansion!

No need to start another game going.

... that wouldn't be called for.

I've already got a game going.

It ominously looms over the entrance.

I don't have anything to ring up.

That won't move around.

It's a glass display case.

I'm not shopping for memorabilia.

It won't move.

It looks back out on the street.

I don't need any of those.

They just hang on the wall.

... ooh, ooh, baby!

... are you going to buy anything today?

... I miss junk food and television!

... this... is great...

... could we... do this... some other time...?

... I suppose... network TV ... will suffice...

That was the tour!

... back to work, I guess.

... come back when you're ready to get fit!

... now to get Anderson!

Hmm... 

I wonder where Morry is...?

Hello, and welcome to 25-Hour Fitness!

Today is a Grrr-eat Day to Get in Shape!

Just let me see that membership card...

... and you can get your workout started!

Silence!

There's no workout being started here...

... I'm trying to get my friend out of this place!

We have a Slackmaster game to...

Where is he...

... back here?

Umm, sir...

Uhh... hehe...

Yeah, um...

... I can't let you in without a membership card.

A membership card?

Yeah, they're kind of... required.

I refuse to interact with it.

It's a big, pink, rubber ball.

Looks like there's a tiny hole used to fill it up with air on it.

It's only discernable weakness.

You shall prove a formidable foe, oh rubber ball.

Not likely.

Victory is mine!

Oh, I'm afraid it's useless now that it's been slain.

Look, someone over there is mocking the pink ball!

Who would do such a despicable thing.

Muhahaha

Gee, they must have ran off.

Well anyways, back to...

I think I sat on it too hard.

That's strange, those balls were designed to hold the weight of a 500 lb. fat person.

I'll have to talk to our distributor about that.

We'll miss you, pink ball.

We'll miss you.

Anyways, is there any other equipment in here you want to try out?

That's not the big pink ball!

Listen I've got other things to be doing in here...

Well you've seen what 25 Hour Fitness has to offer.

The tour is finished.

Pretty cool, huh?

Hardly.

This primitive apparatus looks promising.

Step aside boy.

Let a real man show you how it's done.

Oooh.

That felt good.

Oh sweet lord.

I've become a weakling.

<sob>

Is that person using the cardio equipment properly?

Where?

A little dab on the bar should do quite nicely...

I swear more people hurt themselves that way than...

Hmm.  Everything looks ok in there.

Don't worry lad...

...you'll be familiar with all the proper protocol and procedures when I'm finished with you.

You won't make these stupid mistakes again.

Uh... hehe...

I'm sorry, those aren't free samples.

Oh.

The locker rooms and sauna are for members only!

It leads back into the locker rooms.

It leads out of the buildling.

That's where all the workout stuff is.

I doubt he knows how to operate it.

I've got my own computer if I wanted to do that.

They'd probably make me pay for it.

It's attached to the desk.

It's a big pile o'supplement.

I don't need a sample.

I don't need to do that.

You can't take that.

'Kaboom! High Performance Dietary Supplement'

I don't want any.

The Kaboom display is on it.

That would just knock everything over.

'Tired of exercising...'

'... and not getting those results you were looking for?'

'Try Kaboom! fitness supplement-- FREE!!'

'(see ad in your local paper)'

It's just an ad.

I don't think the ad itself is worth anything.

I suppose this is where the gatekeeper sits.

It's not my desk.

It's an ad for 25-Hour Fitness.

That's not a poster I would want on my wall.

'Kaboom! fitness supplement'

That stuff rocks hard!

Check out our display by the locker room.

I'd rather just ignore it.

I'm guessing it seperates this entrance from the club floor.

No one's in there right now.

No one is using it right now.

... sure!

Sorry, members only!

It's held open by the door stop.

The chair is now propped in front of the door.

Alright, back to work!

Hey!

Leave my doorstop be, or I WILL perpetrate you!

... guess that means I need to put it back.

I don't feel like sitting down.

I don't think he'd mind if I moved this around.

Students only!

... but we have a--

... you can wait in the reception area!

... how long is this class?

... now let's return to the lesson, class.

... very timely.

... a late student?

Sorry, the class has already started...

... try to make it earlier next time!

... I could use a distraction.

You can't leave early!

... back to the lesson!

... Jackson, what are you doing here?

What are YOU doing here...

... we had Slackmaster scheduled today!

... FOCUS!

Now, does anyone have a question about what we're doing here?

Um, I have a question...

... lay it on me!

Alright, now that we have everyone here...

Um... I have another question.

Ok...?

That seat looks available.

I don't need to take a seat.

... that was horrible.

The chair is propped in front of it now.

It's being held open by that doorstop.

It's a doorstop.

It's already holding the door open.

That must be the front desk.

'Good for one FREE personal training session at 25 Hour Fitness!'

There's nothing interesting in there.

I don't think he'll let me go through his desk.

'... take a card for a FREE personal training session at 25-Hour Fitness!'

I just need to take a card, not the whole poster.

It looks comfortable enough...

It looks too heavy to move around.

That looks too heavy to move around.

It's a punching bag.

I'm not much of a pugilist.

I don't really want to touch it.

Looks like they're setup for breaking boards.

I can't break anything on there!

I think they're fine upright.

They would be too heavy to carry around.

It looks out onto the street.

It's so dainty!

No reason to smash it.

I don't need miniature trees.

It occupies some space on the desk.

I don't need to clear it off.

I don't need any of that stuff.

Pretty impressive.

I don't want to mess up his arrangement.

Nobody is using them right now.

I don't have time for stretching!

I don't have time for stretching.

That's probably for practicing tough combo's and finishing moves.

I wouldn't know where to start.

It's a weapon rack.

I don't like to grab things from the foreground...

That must be where the outside vent ends up!

That must be the stock of boards to break.

I can't break boards.

It's the chair for the desk.

I'll just leave that where it is.

They keep it interesting enough in here...

That's an interesting color...

I can't break those things!

Great board you got here Steve-o.

I'm definitely not changing into those.

It's a sweaty old basketball jersey.

No way am I touching that!

... and FINALLY, after rescuing both of you...

... we're ready to get some GAME time in today!

Hey, EXERCISE is hard work!

... you can't snap ME out of the ZONE!

I was learning how to groin stomp!

... after careful THOUGHT and MEDITATION!

You DON'T UNDERSTAND what I've been DOING all morning...

... just to get some hack-n-slash ACTION in today!

... and so, after regaining FULL CONSCIOUSNESS...

... I peeled myself off the cement, and pushed on...

... UNDETERRED and UNDAUNTED!

She DROPPED you from a window?

... wow, that had to HURT!

... what DISCIPLINE!

What did you DO when we WEREN'T THERE?

... WHAT!?  You mean he bought that RUSE?

... he wasn't the sharpest TOOL on that lot!

... why did you MANIPULATE him, again?

... to get a CLEAR PATH at his MASTER!

What does this have to do with US!

... where's the ACTION!

What happened to his cane just doesn't make SENSE!

Geez, how about a little UNDERSTANDING here...

... this WASN'T as EASY as it sounds!

... so that's what he HEARD!

I thought he'd just HIT his head ONE-TOO-MANY times.

How did you REACH Anderson and get him OUT of there?

Guys, that's only HALF of the story!

At least I WANTED TO LEAVE!

... but it was so WARM and RELAXING!

... as FATE would have it, Anderson did not put up as much of a FIGHT...

... c'mon, I was MENTALLY FATIGUED!

At least I COULD RELAX whilst awaiting my RESCUE!

... argh! I never learned a good way to FINISH someone!

As FATE would have it, Morry was a little more STUBBORN...

... c'mon, I was PHYSICALLY DRAINED!

... and that's how the PROCESS came to an END!

I never learned a good way to FINISH someone!

... it was so WARM and RELAXING!

... hey guys!

... could I... DO this THING... some OTHER time?

... but was it really WORTH the ENERGY?

... want to hop on this one over here?

Ooh, that one over there is ALWAYS a nice workout!

... I'll miss that fitness ball!

Sooo, just hop on there when you're ready...

... whenever you're ready to get started.

These fitness balls are GREAT!

... this time I've got it!

I may need a spot on this one...

... am I coming down with something?

Ok... one more time!

... maybe I need to get my chest warmed up.

... I have been working out all day...

... just a small setback!

I need to go...

Come back and we'll pick up right where we left off!

Alright!

Now where to start...?

... there's so much great stuff in here!

... I don't see Morry over here...

Ok...

... over here, we have some of our leg machines!

... I don't really use these that much...

... but the ladies really like'em so it's sort of a...

... uh...

A catch-22?

Yeah!... One of those things!

Listen, I'm...

Oh don't worry, sport!

... we have more than just machines!

... but I--

Check this one out, my personal favorite...

... the BENCH PRESS!

This is GREAT for showing everyone how strong you are...

... use a workout partner for best results!

... Hey!

Count'em out for me, partner!

One..?

Two..?

Um, I'm moving on...

Wow, I like your enthusiasm!

... this is great...

It's EXACTLY what I had in mind for you!

These fitness balls are AMAZING!

You could work every muscle group on this bouncing beauty!

... I don't see Morry anywhere.

So, what do you think?

Catch-22, remember?

Right!

My personal favorite, the bench press!

... and, of course, these amazing FITNESS BALLS!

... I don't see Morry in here.

I know right where we should start...

... the fitness ball!

We can do your entire workout on this!

Now where should we start...?

Woah! Is she using that leg machine IMPROPERLY?

W-Where!?

WHERE!?

Mmm, that felt good.

Um...

... I think I broke it.

Huh?

These fitness balls are designed to withstand the weight of a 500 lbs. fat person!

Well at least we'll have time to check out the locker rooms!

We're not ready to hit the showers, yet!

This is a great opportunity to use the REST of the equipment!

This sure is a great facility!

Yeah... just LOOK at it...

I already put some glue on there.

What's this one all about...?

No, no, no...

... you've got it all wrong!

... let ME show you how that's to be DONE!

What a whimpy whimp...

No, no... I'll do it!

... you're doing it all wrong!

Let ME show you how that's to be done...

See how rewarding that is!

I'm impressed on the inside...

It's a big pink fitness ball.

Not a chance.

I don't want to encourage him.

I don't see any way to deflate it...

I can't close that.

I'm not taking that with me.

It appears to be some sort of BENCH with a set of weights...

...to be PRESSED over one's chest.

Doesn't look like anyone is on it right now.

Hey, what're you doing?

You can do it better on the ball!

I don't want to get my legs too tired!

I don't really want an ab workout...

Those must be popular.

It must be some sort of abdominal workout...

I really don't want to get on that.

That must be the aerobics room.

I don't really want to go in there...

It's probably fake.

I don't need to dig around in it.

There's nothing special about it.

What do you need to go over there for?

You got everything you need right here!

They probably keep them locked.

It's the weight rack.

They all look pretty heavy.

Ho-ho we can get to those later...

... let's get some work done on the fitness ball first!

I don't think I'm strong enough to lift that.

... there's more of them?

Hold on there partner...

... we've already got one out!

I don't want to get another one out!

It holds the fitness balls.

It looks sturdy.

They keep it bright in here.

Nobody's on them right now.

It seperates the floor area from the entrance.

It looks to heavy to move.

Hey! The fitness ball is over here!

We'll move on after we're through with it!

I slayed it.

It's not very useful without air.

I don't need to be hauling a corpse around.

I don't think that could do enough damage.

There's not really a hole to poke it in.

It doesn't need to be glued.

It leads back to the front desk area.

More weight room equipment over there.

There's enough equipment to choose from over here.

I can't lift that bar!

... he needs to focus.

He'll be working on that for a while...

Someone's on it right now.

I don't think he wants help.

Stupid vacuum.

I don't think I want to start vacuuming.

I need to get to the game shop!

I wouldn't want to take Mom's favorite toy.

... WHERE'S THE ENTERTAINMENT!

... THESE ANKLES AREN'T GOING TO MASSAGE THEMSELVES!

... IF I EVER SEE THAT BIRD AGAIN!

I'm gonna...

Fsck!  Fsck!

My legs!

YOU...

Raaaaaawwwr.

Arrgghh!

Get over here!

Are they finally done in there?

He can be fairly protective when he's eating.

I guess he's not done eating yet.

Reeeeeoooowwrr!

Oh, c'mon Rufus!

It's just a vacuum!

He's never liked vacuums.

This might be a while...

Back already?

I'm having trouble rounding up the troops!

Grandma's in the kitchen...

... Grandpa's watching TV in the other room...

... and Thurston is upstairs in the shower!

It doesn't need to be left open.

WHERE'S THE VOLUME FOR THIS THING?!

ALRIGHT, I'M READY TO GO UPSTAIRS NOW!

THESE COMMERCIALS AREN'T FUNNY!

C'mon Rufus...

HEY, RUFUS!

... CHECK THIS ACTION OUT!

Meeeooooowwwwrr!

... THAT'S ONE WEIRD CAT!

... that's one weird Grandparent.

... here Rufus!

-snort-

... he was out of options.

I think I should just leave it open for now.

It's propped open now.

This must have fallen out of his pocket when he stood up!

They lead upstairs.

I should just go in if I need to talk to someone in there.

It leads back into the laundry room.

Doesn't look like we're going to be eating any time soon.

Finishing the game will have to take priority over breakfast today.

There's nothing to be picked up.

It's another nice day outside.

I'm through messing around with windows.

There's nobody outside to yell at.

It's for writing down phone messages and notes.

I can't think of anything clever enough to write on it.

I think it's better off on the wall.

It's a telephone.

I don't need to call anyone right now.

I don't need to talk to anyone on the phone right now.

I can't get distracted with that right now.

It's a little big to be carrying around.

These couches are great.

I don't need to rest these spry legs just yet.

There's anything under the couch.

I check under the cushions for change all the time.

Nothing but a couple magazines on it.

There's nothing to pick up.

I don't think I should move it.

It's really only useful to set things on while you're watching television

Some old family pictures.

I don't think anyone outside of family and friends needs to see these.

Oh you rogue, you.

Yep, that's me.

Mirror, mirror, on the wall

Who's the most l33t gamer of them all?

I don't want to accidentally break it.

I can't afford any more bad luck at the gaming table.

It's a swinging door that leads into the kitchen.

I can just go in the kitchen if I need to talk with someone.

It's the doorstop I got from Steve's.

What better place for a doorstop than holding a door open?

Some sunflower seeds fell on the ground when I pushed the flower.

Looks like his pocketknife slipped out of his pants when he stood up.

HEY, BOY!

I'VE BEEN WAITIN' FOR YOU TO DRAG YOUR TAIL IN HERE!

NOW, COME OVER HERE AND SIT A SPELL WITH GRAMPS!

sigh.

Listen Grandpa, I can't really sit down right--

--NOPE!

CAN'T HERE YA!

... TOOK MY HEARING AID OUT...

... CAN'T FIND IT WITHOUT MY CANE!

There's nothing important in there.

I don't want to mess up anything in the livingroom.

It's just sitting next to the TV.

I don't need any plants.

I don't want to mess up the livingroom

I'd rather just leave it there.

It's colorful.

I walk on it anytime I want.

I know there's not anything under there.

YOU'RE BLOCKING THE TUBE, BOY!

DON'T LET THAT CAT IN HERE!

CAN'T YOU SEE I'M WATCHING TV HERE!

Can't you stay in one place?

Try not to make a mess upstairs...

Laundry's not my thing.

Looks like some change fell out in here.

It's empty now.

There's nothing in there now.

I don't want to do the laundry right now.

It looks like some change fell out in there.

The washing machine is empty now.

There you are, Rufus!

Always glad to see me!

The door is already closed.

I don't think I need to mess with it anymore.

Wet clothes aren't interesting.

It leads back into the living room.

It's a nice day out there.

An unused wire hangar.

It's our clothes dryer.

That would require herculean strength.

It's our washing machine.

Looks reliable enough.

I'll let Mom handle the ironing.

I don't want to lug that around with me.

I'm not interesting in doing laundry.

It's fine where it is.

I don't want to do laundry right now.

None of MY clothes came through here.

I think my current outfit is doing fine.

I can take them upstairs later.

Looks like it just got emptied today.

I don't have anything I'd want to throw away.

Why make a mess?

There's nothing in there.

I don't have an immediate use for it.

Sure is dark in there.

It looks like a coin fell out in there.

Looks like a coin fell out in there.

It's a coin.

It must have fallen out of someone's clothes.

Clothes get hung up on there after they're dry.

I don't need to hang anything up.

I don't need to knock it over.

I definitely don't need the whole rack.

I don't have much experience with the stuff.

I don't need to do the laundry.

That would just make a mess.

It belongs in the laundry room.

I guess it doesn't get used much.

I don't even know how to use bleach.

It would be more trouble than it's worth.

There's nothing on there.

There aren't any drawers.

Looks like they run upstairs and into the kitchen from here.

They look like they're already working.

They look way too strong to bend.

They're securely fastened to the wall.

Squuaaaaaawk.

I can't go in there, that's my Mom's room.

Grandma and Grandpa are downstairs Jackson.

You don't need anything in there.

Rats.

I can't go in there, that's my parents room.

Dang.

... see, it's not that hard to get him back in his cage!

It takes more time for me to vacuum up the birdseed that he spills...

... there has to be a way out of this without going down there.

... on your way to the shower, I see!

This isn't amusing.

Squaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwk!

Aaaack!

... squawk.

THURSTON?

ARE YOU IN THERE?

He usually just stays around his cage.

I don't want to ruin the cage.

They lead downstairs.

Pick up stairs?

I wouldn't even know where to begin.

I don't need to talk to anyone down there.

Loos like Grandma and Grandpa are staying in the guest room.

Hello guestroom!

It's the guestroom door.

Open sesame!

Didn't seem to work.

Thurston must be using the shower.

It's the bathroom door.

Hey Thurston!

Hurry up in there!

You're using all the hot water!

Save some for the whales!

You poohead.

There's no one in there.

It's the bathroom.

It wouldn't have anything interesting to say.

Right Mr. Bathroom?

The cage needs it more than I do.

The cage door is wide open.

That's my Mom's room, it's off limits.

No ones in there.

It leads back down the hall.

It looks nice enough.

That stuff's just good for decoration.

Seems like those pictures have been up there forever.

They're better off on the wall.

They get bumped enough as it is.

Knuckles has a lot of stuff in there to play with.

It's a little too small for me.

I don't want to knock the whole cage over.

There's no way to unlock these doors from the outside.

Believe me, I've tried.

It's there for the birdcage to sit on.

I don't need to knock the whole cage over.

We don't keep anything in there.

It looks a little weak.

That's just an old family photo.

I don't need that.

It must be fine china.

I'd rather not touch it.

It blocks off the stairwell.

I'm not taking a shower.

The curtains are already closed.

Who doesn't need a doorstop?

GIMME A SEC...

... I'M IN THE SHOWER!!

I'm starting to run out of hot water in here...

WOA-WOAH-C-C-COLD!!

Yikes! ... We're out of hot water already?

Elegant, clean, porcelain...

... everything I look for in a toilet.

I don't have to go right now.

I prefer to let the inner workings of a toilet remain a mystery.

... I'm not getting in there now!

... I'm better off avoiding them.

That's a clean sink.

It closes to keep water from splashing out.

It's holding the door open.

I'll just take one.

"It cleans deep down in your skin"

"and removes dirt and grime from your pores"

"smooth as your skin's ever been"

"Use oxy-cill."

Hmm. That last line just doesn't work.

... looking good.

I haven't looked in here for a while...

These things really cleanse deep!

... I think one should be enough.

I think just one pad should be enough.

I'm not crazy.

It's a fixture.

A perfect day for a sweet game of Slackmaster!

I'm not sure this one opens...

It leads back to the hallway.

... it's not going anywhere.

... it's a little scummy.

I don't need the soap.

I hope it's double-ply.

I'm good.

There's no need to have spare toilet paper on-hand.

Always on duty.

...nothing needs plunging.

I'll leave that for any emergency flooding.

That stuff doesn't look too interesting.

That stuff doesn't really interest me...

It belongs with the shower.

It must be Thurston's bathrobe.

I'm not sure when he started wearing one of those.

Mabye I should just pick it up for now.

Hey, it's my prescription strength facial cleanser!

I should just pick one up.

Looks like Thurston left his shower sponge out.

It's already dry.

I step on it all the time.

It's useful where it is.

I don't think I should move it around.

I don't want to lug a bath mat around.

That's the faucet for the sink.

... why waste the water?

It has things hanging on it occasionally.

I don't have anything to hang there.

... it's soap.

There's no reason to panic...

That's the faucet for the tub.

I don't feel like running a bath...

It puts out a good spray.

... not now.

That's our bathtub.

... I don't need to run a bath.

There's nothing in it.

... THAT WAS EXCITING.

NOW LET'S GET CRACKIN' ON THAT HEARING AID!

Maybe you left it in Thurston's room...?

... EH?

I don't have any clothes to put away.

I don't have anything to put in it.

What IS this thing?

It leads back into the hall.

It's a chest.

With drawers.

They add some color to the room.

I don't want to make a mess in here.

I'm sure they smell great.

They don't need any encouragement

They're doing just fine.

It would be better to leave them in the water.

It leads out into the hall.

Looks like there is some strange garment in here.

It some strange frilly garment.

I've never seen anything like it.

I guess Grandma and Grandpa will be sleeping here tonight.

I don't feel like jumping on beds right now.

It's too heavy to pick up.

I don't want to mess around with any more windows.

... I heard you coming a mile away!

... yep!

I LIKE TO BE ON MY FEET!

I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING!

KNUCKLES LOVES THOSE SEEDS!

It looks a little dried out.

I don't know what to do with it.

... Maybe I can knock a couple seeds off of it.

Bingo.

I'm not willing to carry a flower around.

We've had that chair forever.

I don't need to rest yet.

A lonely island of carpet in a sea of wood flooring.

I can walk on it anytime I want.

I don't want to move it around.

There's nothing under there.

That must be some species of ivy.

They look nice and fluffy.

I'm not tired.

I don't really need pillows.

It looks warm.

I'm not messing around with anymore bedspreads.

I'm not sure what it is I'm looking at.

I don't think I can do that.

I don't feel like pushing that...

I don't think I could pull that off.

That's not needed.

I can't open it.

I can't close it.

I don't think that needs comforting.

That doesn't need to be covered.

I don't want to tie it to that.

That doesn't need to be smitten.

That doesn't need deep cleansing action.

I don't think that's a good spot for it.

I'm going to save it for now.

I want to keep the blade sharp.

Somebody should want these.

That wouldn't accomplish much.

They wouldn't do any good there.

I'd rather hold on to it.

I don't want to get hung up on that.

I don't feel like wiping that down.

I don't need to glue that.

I don't want to take any chances with this...

That doesn't need greasin'.

I'll just hang on to it.

No need to smash it!

That doesn't need a charge.

I would prefer a flat surface...

That doesn't need to eat dice.

That would just be a mess.

I don't want to waste it on that!

I'm not through with it yet.

They should take this up front.

It only fits in the back.

I should give this to someone.

I'm not sure that would work.

I don't want to waste a buck on that!

I don't think I should leave him there.

That doesn't need cooling.

I don't want to leave it there.

I need something to change back into!

That can't hear!

That wouldn't work.

That wouldn't have much to say.

I don't think I need that.

I'm not sure what it is, but it's cool looking!

That's ludicrous.

I'm not that bored.

That won't work.  Ignoramous.

I can't pick that up.

It appears to be alive.

I .

I don't want to push her.

I could just talk to her...

She won't need that.

That doesn't make sense.

There's no deal to close here!

I'm not in the mood.

I don't think she needs comforting.

She doesn't need to be covered.

I can't tie her up.

She doesn't need to be smitten.

She doesn't need deep cleansing action.

She doesn't need a doorstop.

No need for a stabbing.

I don't think she needs these.

She doesn't need to know I have this.

She won't want these.

She's fully dressed.

She doesn't care about a hangar.

She doesn't need wiping down.

He doesn't need hearing aids!

I don't feel like giving out piggy backs.

I couldn't lift him.

This could come in handy.

It wouldn't have much to say.

That wouldn't be a good combination.

... I'm going to have to get back to you on this.

...yep, and a bird took his cane!

... huh?

... I was paying for the haute dog when I heard Grandpa hollering!

I looked over, and saw him jumping up and down in a fit...

... without his cane!

... and what did he say happened?

Hi, honey.

It should be able to support my weight.

I haven't wielded dexcalibur since our last live-action Dungeon Slack campaign...

Deep cleansing action at my fingertips!

It's a rubber door stop.

The blade looks sharp!

These look really good.

What a BIZARRE elastic device...

... what could it possibly be used for?

It's Thurston's bath robe.

This wire hangar should come in handy.

It's a dry sponge.

Grandpa's had this cane forever.

Are you done now.

Yeah... I guess I am.

Excuse me...

... ready to buy a Haute Dog yet?

Could I ask you a question?

Shoot!

I don't want to mess up his concentration.

Could I talk to you for a minute?

You know, I was like you once...

Hello, worker...

Oh, hey there kid...

... WHAT'S THAT?

DID YOU SMASH YOURSELF AGAIN?

Say, worker...

These old dice just couldn't crack my starting line-up!

Alright babies, nothing but nat-twenties ok?

This sling should do 1d6 + 1d4 + 1d20 points of damage.

... I'll just scare him with a taste of my broadside!

... that should be enough to get that cane down!

... look at him flee!

He enjoys his job.

It's a squirt bottle filled with ketchup.

It does look pretty good.

Too bad it's a hotdog.

I guess this might be more useful straightened out.

There, it's now a straight, stiff wire.

Hey Anderson, what are you doing here?

Stupid karate lessons.

Get me out of here.

Hey, Rufus...

Ok, well I'll, uh...

... see you later, then!

Say, Gamekeep...

It's a portable CD player.

Hey, there's a free coupon for that Kaboom! stuff in here!

I already ripped the Kaboom! coupon out.

It's today's copy of the local newspaper.

I found a coupon in the paper for that Kaboom! stuff over there!

Cool!

... I knew you were looking to beef up!

Grab one from the display over there...

Don't worry, sport...

... you'll be up to a buck-fifty in no time!

This is so humiliating...

Say... this could make a good sling!

Maybe he'll give up that last drink...

... if he gets a taste of Kaboom! again!

That tasted funny...

Wooooo-hooooooooooooo!

I guess that worked...

... look what I found!

... BUT... HOW DID YOU KILL THAT BIRD?

I didn't!  I just had to think a litt--

... a deal has been struck!

I've got this card for a free personal--

... Personal training session!

With me?

ALRIGHT!

Let's just get this over with, ok?

Let's do this!

I found your hearing aid...

... you left it in Thurston's room!

I DID...?

... THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANY BATTERIES!

CAN'T YOU ROUND UP A COUPLE BATTERIES?

All this for a dollar...

I should wait until she's finished vacuuming.

... you want some seed, Knuckles?

Then come on out of your cage and get it!

... are you still hungry?

Ouch!  Ow!  Oooh!

Squawk.

I should open his cage first.

He's not able to communicate right now.

It should work fine now!

It should work now.

Ok, here's your hearing aid...

... WITH batteries this time...

It's a miracle, I can hear again!

Now, about that DOLLAR you owe me...

... time to pay the piper!

You need a dollar...?

You just had to ask, boy!

Hey Knuckles...

... yes? 

He doesn't really let me touch him...

... but he knows who's boss!

I should open the cage door first.

... I don't want to get him angry!

He's very self-sufficient.

Hey bird!

Give me that cane!

I don't think he's listening to me.

Hey Jackson...

... KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF ME!

That is a noisy one...

... you're coming with me, whether you like it or not!

... no, NO, GET AWAY!

... that's a good spot for it.

... I guess it's watching over the lot.

I've got it sitting in the vent now.

I'm not close enough to use it...

... is that all you have to say?

He doesn't appear susceptible to physical attacks.

I don't see a way to open it.

I couldn't give him away.

... I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT PAIN IS!

He doesn't need more mockery.

I don't see a way to open that.

Hey Grandma...

Hey Jackson.

... I think I found the missing ingredient for your brownies!

Wha--!

... but where did you fi--

Err, I mean...

This could be a suitable replacement for my secret ingredient!

Soo... you'll make your brownies today, right?

Sure! Let me just finish chopping these vegetables...

... then I'll get started on the brownies!

Sweet!

... AND, since you were such a big help for me...

... go tell your Grandfather to give you a DOLLAR!

That can be a little present from me to you...

... but Grandpa lost his--

Oh don't worry, I know he's good for it!

Now run along, I've got a lot of cooking to do!

He looks busy...

... I can't reach him up there!

... I can't touch him up there!

There must be something he'd prefer besides cane.

It's a shiny quarter.

'... WARNING: not to be mixed with other stimulants.

I throw like a girl...

It's a coupon for Kaboom! that was in the paper.

I need some sort of ranged weapon...

... would you trade that cane for some seed?

Guess he's not interested.

He doesn't look like he reads the paper much.

I grabbed a handful.

It has some grease on it now.

It's a solid looking piece of wood.

Hmm... It doesn't have any batteries...

I know they have some juice left in them.

That's some powerful supplement you got there!

'Gamekeep Mix, Volume 1'

Chocolate and caffeine, what a combination!

It's the CD player, sans disc.

There's no CD to listen to.

It doesn't have any batteries.

Maybe there's something else I can grab from this...

... these batteries might be useful!

There's nothing more to take out of it.

He was starting to get on my nerves...

It's filled with ice to keep it cool.

it's not close enough to converse with...

... it's not in the mood for a rational discussion.

It doesn't need more mockery.

I may have a better use for them...

Morry!

... did you have a question?

... I'm not ready to have a personal trainer.

I don't think I can muscle him around.

... he's focused on fitness.

... she does love to vacuum.

... I can't reach the cane from here.

... he looks gullible.

He's too big too shove around.

He's giving it his all.

He wouldn't stand for it.

I'll let her handle the vacuuming.

I give her affection all the time.

No need to take over the vacuuming...

He looks spry and chipper this morning...

He's entranced with the programming.

He's only really good for GM'ing...

He's very sensitive to that sort of thing.

... he doesn't want my attention.

He's taking in a beverage at the park.

He's sitting down right now.

I don't know him that well.

I don't think he needs anything.

I should talk to him...

He's behind the counter.

He's interested in money.

He's not very mobile without the cane.

He's content stretching his legs.

He's useless without his hearing aid.

I'd rather just find his cane...

... it's better to ignore him.

... I don't need to move him.

Generally, he's self-sufficient...

I don't think he needs more attention.

Finding his cane would be easier...

... I'm not giving out piggy-backs.

She's busy chopping on the cutting board...

I don't want to interfere.

I'm trying to stay out of her way.

... if I were her ingredient, she'd be interested.

No need to try that.

He's definitely alert.

He really looks excited...

I'm not ready for a personal trainer!

He has a lot of toys to play with in his cage.

... he's feeding.

He's sleeping right now.

... he's past where Mom was vacuuming.

... he's over by the kitchen door.

What a handsome kitty!

He's intructing the class.

... he's looking agitated.

He looks a little high-strung.

He's KO'd.

He skilled in hand-to-hand combat!

He'd smash me!

He doesn't look very receptive.

He'd smash me if I'd try that!

He looks frustratingly calm!

I'm not touching his sweaty, naked skin!

He's too big to move around!

... he's not interested in anything.

I'm not sure what he was thinking.

He could use cooling down.
